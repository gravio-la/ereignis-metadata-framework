# Data Stores

The EDB Framework supports a variety of data stores. An Abstract Datastore is an interface, that provides the
basic CRUD functionality and some list and utility functions. Some data stores work within the client and within
the server, others are only available on the server.

  The interface make the underlying data store to behave like a document store, where highly linked documents can be
retrieved in one go in a single query. The data store, will most likely use the JSON schema to construct its queries or
to create the necessary indexes during the bootstrap phase.

  The reference implementation is using the SPARQL query language to provide a RDF based data store, that can be used
from the client and the server.


## SPARQL Data Store

The package `@slub/sparql-db-implementation` provides a SPARQL based data store implementation. The data store is
using SPARQL 1.1  Update, Select and Construct queries to interact with the data store. By using the JSON schema
provided.

## RESTful Data Store

The package `@slub/restful-fetch-db-implementation` provides a RESTful based data store implementation. It will store and query
the data via fetch requests. A reference REST API implementation can be found under `./apps/edb-api`. The REST API itself can
use any kind of data store.

The package `@slub/restful-fetch-db-implementation`

The API is documented using the OpenAPI 3.0 specification, thus the API can be explored using Swagger UI.

Within the package `@slub/edb-state-hooks`, this implementation will be used by the hook `useDataStore` if the `provider` of the endpoint-configuration
is set to `rest`.

A Restful Data Store can be initialized with the following configuration:

```typescript
import { initRestfullStore } from "@slub/restfull-fetch-db-impl";
const schema = {...}

initRestfullStore({
            apiURL: "http://localhost:3001",
            defaultPrefix: "http://ontologies.slub-dresden.de/exhibition#",
            typeNameToTypeIRI: (typeName: string) => `http://ontologies.slub-dresden.de/exhibition#${typeName}`,
            schema,
            defaultLimit: 10,
          })
```

## Prisma Data Store


The package `@slub/prisma-db-implementation` provides a Prisma based data store implementation. It will store and query
the data via Prisma ORM, which itself supports a wide range of databases, like MariaDB, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB.
For a complete list of supported databases, see [Prisma Database Support](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/reference/supported-databases)

Because Prisma itself uses a schema and needs database migration if the model changes, we loose a little bit of flexibility
compared to the SPARQL Data Store. But we gain a lot of performance and can use the full power of the underlying database.

### Prisma Data Store Configuration

By setting the environment variable `DATABASE_URL`  to the connection string of the database
and `DATABASE_PROVIDER`, the Prisma Data Store can be initialized .

Assuming we already creafted our model with JSON schema, we can initialize the Prisma Data Store with the following configuration:

In the root of the project run:

  ```bash
bun run build:prisma
```

This will build the prisma schema, that is being put into the `prisma` folder.
The next step is to generate the prisma client. Prisma uses code generation
to create an optimal client for the database. This can be done by running:

```bash
bun run prisma:exhibition:generate
```

It will install a package called `@prisma/edb-exhibition-client` that can be used within the API
and CLI. But a last step is necessary to initialize the database itself. If the database already exists
it will run migrations on the database to accommodate the schema changes. This can be done by running:

```bash
bun run prisma:exhibition:migrate
```

Once we have initialized the database, we can seed it or import data from another data store using the cli.

```bash
bun run cli import Exhibition --importFrom oxigraph
```

This will import all entities of the type `Exhibition` from the oxigraph data store.
It requires `oxigraph` to be set as import store in the configuration.
