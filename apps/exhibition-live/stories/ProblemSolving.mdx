# Problem Solving

This package is dedicated to problems that can occur during development and how to solve them.

## Reinstall all dependencies

## next.js Development errors

Sometime dependencies are not compatible with next.js in dev mode and it throws errors like below:

```
adb-next:dev:  тип ../../node_modules/@jsonforms/material-renderers/node_modules/@mui/icons-material/node_modules/@babel/runtime/helpers/interopRequireDefault.js
adb-next:dev: Module parse failed: Cannot use 'import.meta' outside a module (38:6)
adb-next:dev: File was processed with these loaders:
```

First one has to check whether the error does not appear in production mode, by building the project and running it.
If it really just shows up in dev mode and a complete reinstallation of node dependencies does not help, one can try to exclude the problematic module from being transpiled by next.js.
Delete it manually from the `node_modules` folder and add it to the `transpileModules` array in the `next.config.js` file.
