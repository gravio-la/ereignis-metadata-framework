# Development Workflows

## Monorepo

The EDB Framework follows the software-development-strategy of a [Monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo). This means that all the code for the EDB Framework is stored in a single repository,
along with concrete applications and example projects.

Within the root of the project you will find the following directories:

- `packages` - Contains all the packages that make up the EDB Framework, including frontend-components, backend-services, and shared libraries.
- `apps` - Contains concrete applications that use the EDB Framework, including the EDB Cli (Console tools for managing EDB projects), and the EDB Web App for exhibitions.
- `manifestations` - Contains data models and declaration files for concrete EDB instances

By using `turbo` we make sure that every package can be built and tested in isolation, while still being able to reference other packages in the monorepo
and build-pipelines know the internal dependency graph of all packages, thus ensuring that changes to one package are propagated to all dependent packages.

To build all packages in the monorepo, run the following command:

```bash
bun run build:packages
```
which is an alias for `turbo run build --filter=@slub/* --continue`, which will build all packages in the monorepo
within the `@slub` namespace. It will build all packages in parallel, and continue building even if some packages fail.

## Apps

The `apps` directory contains concrete applications that use the EDB Framework. These applications are built using dependencies, from the
workspace within the `packages` and `manifestations` directory.

### EDB Cli

The EDB Cli is a command-line tool for accessing and mapping data according to the current EDB data model defined by the JSON Schema.

To run the EDB Cli, run the following command:

```bash
bun run cli
```
It will show you the available subcommands and options.

```
edb-cli <subcommand>

where <subcommand> can be one of:

- list
- get
- flatImport - Import of flat table structured documents
- import - Recursively import data from another data store

For more help, try running `edb-cli <subcommand> --help`
```

#### Retrieving Data

Use the list or get command to retrieve data from the EDB Cli. The list command will list all documents, while the get command will retrieve a specific data object.

```bash
bun run cli list Person -n 10
```
will list 10 documents of the type `Person`.

```bash
bun run cli get Person http://ontologies.slub-dresden.de/exhibition/entity#XYZ
```
will retrieve the document with the id `http://ontologies.slub-dresden.de/exhibition/entity#XYZ` of the type `Person`.


## Versioning

Versioning is done using `changesets`. Changesets should only be generated when publishing new releases of the EDB Framework. To generate a new changeset, run the following command:

```bash
# Add a new changeset
changeset

# Create new versions of packages
changeset version

# Publish all changed packages to npm
changeset publish
```

## Local Development

For development one needs `bun` and `node` installed. To install `bun` run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g @bun/cli
```

Node can be installed from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/).

If you prefer to use `docker` for development, you can use the provided `docker-compose` file to start a development environment.
