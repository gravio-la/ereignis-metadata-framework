# The frameworks architecture


## The basic configuration

The configuration can be split into three main parts that are configurable independently:

1. The data model and its view specific declarations
2. The storage layer
3. The Linked Data Mapping and Prefixing


The third part of the configuration will be used by the storage layer and is responsible
to guarantee, that the data produced can always be represented as RDF, no matter which storage
strategy is being used.

Let's dive into it and examine the specific configuration for a simplified exhibition database.


### The data model

In order to maintain a good structure the current data model lives in its own NPM package within the monorepo.
This allows us to easily share the data model between different parts of the application and amongst CLI, API
and the UI.

It is located within the `@slub/exhibition-schema` packages located within the `manifestation` directory.

Even though it could be a simple JSON File it is a TypeScript file to allow for better type checking and
help with the development process. By using the `JSONSchema7` from the `json-schema` package, we'll get code assistance
and validity checking. It won't compile if there is an error and schema is not compliant with the JSON Schema 7 standard.

```typescript
import { JSONSchema7 } from "json-schema";

export const schema: JSONSchema7 = {
  $schema: "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  $id: "https://schema.adb.arthistoricum.net/exhibition",
  $defs: {
    Tag: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        title: {
          type: "string",
          maxLength: 200,
        },
        description: {
          type: "string",
        },
        image: {
          type: "string",
          format: "uri",
        },
        parent: {
          title: "Übergeordnetes Schlagwort",
          $ref: "#/$defs/Tag",
        },
      },
    },
    Exhibition: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        title: {
          type: "string",
          maxLength: 200,
        },
        tags: {
          type: "array",
          items: {
            $ref: "#/$defs/Tag",
          },
        },
      },
    }
  }
};
```

Here we see a simple example of a schema that defines an `Exhibition` and a `Tag`. The `Tag` can have a parent tag
and an image. The `Exhibition` can have a title and an array of tags.

The convention within the Ereignis-Framework is that each entity defined in `definitions` or `$defs` (both are valid
according to the JSON Schema 7 standard) is a separate entity that can be stored in the database.

Internally the schema will be enhanced with additional properties making it valid JSONLD. As a schema implementer you
don't have to worry about this, as the framework will take care of it. If you want to know more about its internals
read on in at [that chapter](#jsonld-enhancement-and-schema-stubbing).

### JSONLD enhancement and schema stubbing

Some parts of the framework use a transformed version of your schema, to add additional properties that are necessary
or should be added implicitly, without the need to incorporate it within the schema in the first place.

In the `@slub/edb-state-hooks` package you will find a hook called `useExtendedSchema`. It will look into  the current
global app context and return a schema, that is stubbed and enhanced with the necessary properties.

after calling `const schema = useExtendedSchema({ typeName: 'Exhibition' });` you will get a schema that looks like this:

```json
{
    "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
    "$id": "https://schema.adb.arthistoricum.net/exhibition",
    "$defs": {
        "TagStub": {
            "type": "object",

                    "type": "string",

        "@id": {
            "title": "http://ontologies.slub-dresden.de/exhibition/entity/",
            "type": "string"

    },
    "required": [
        "@type",
        "@id"
    ]
}
```

Quite a bit more than the original. What has happened here?

First of all, all entities have been extended with a `@type` and `@id` property. The `@type` property is a constant
that will be the same for each instance of a certain type. The `@id` property is a string that will be used to identify
the entity within the graph. If you are not familiar with JSONLD you can read more about it in the [JSONLD specification](https://json-ld.org/)
or learn within the [JSONLD Playground](https://json-ld.org/playground/).

Second every entity type has a "partner" definition, suffixed with `Stub`. This is a stubbed version of the entity that
has no linked data property. This will be used within the storage layer if we want to make sure only the toplevel entity
gets fetched or stored, without any linked items.

Lastly, the definition of the type `Exhibition` has been added to the top level of the schema. That will tell the methods using
the schema, that this is the top level entity and should be used as the main entity type, we are referring to.

When loading the form for a `Tag` the `Tag`-definition will be at the top level, when loading the form for an `Exhibition`
the `Exhibition`-definition will be at the top level and so on.

Other implicit properties can be added to the schema by configuring the AdbContext. Looking at the `exhibitionAdbConfig` we
see that a function called `makeStubSchema` is being passed to the `AdbContext`. This function will be called with the
`useExtendedSchema` hook instead of the default one if provided. It uses the `prepareStubbedSchema` from `@slub/json-schema-utils`
and adds in addition to the already covered `@type` and `@id` properties, the `idAuthority` property, which is being used
for this specific database as link to other norm databases a bit like the common `sameAs` property in RDF.

```typescript
import {prepareStubbedSchema} from "@slub/json-schema-utils";
import {JSONSchema7} from "json-schema";

export const makeStubSchema = (
  schema: JSONSchema7
) => {
  return prepareStubbedSchema(
    schema,
    (modelName: string) => ({
    "@type": {
      const: `http://ontologies.slub-dresden.de/exhibition#${modelName.replace(/Stub$/, "")}`,
      type: "string",
    },
    "@id": {
      type: "string",
    },
    idAuthority: {
      title: "Autorität",
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        "@id": {
          title: "IRI",
          type: "string",
        },
      },
    },
  }),
  (_modelName: string) => ["@type", "@id"],
  {
      excludeType: ["InvolvedPerson", "InvolvedCorporation", "AuthorityEntry"],
      excludeSemanticPropertiesForType: ["AuthorityEntry"],
  });
};
```

Within the example provided you can also see, that certain types and properties can be excluded, that does only mean, that no stub schema
will be created for these types or properties.
