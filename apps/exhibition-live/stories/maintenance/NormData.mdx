# Mapping from authorities and secondary databases

The UI and the Backend makes use of declarative mapping configurations and a set of extensible
mapping Strategies to map secondary databases and authorities to the internal data model.

Items, that have been found in an external database are being mapped according to the external mapping declaration, that exists
in the configuration of the manifestation of the EDB-Database.

## Usage throughout the application

Those declarative mappings are being used when importing data and when manually linking items to external databases.
Typically, when entering a historical record into the database, relations to persons, organisations, places, etc. are being created.
The mapping will then not only record the link to the external database itself but also map the external data to the internal data model.

This is done when linking data using the [Similarity Finder](/docs/development-similarity-finder--docs) or when importing data from other sources.

## Mapping Declaration

when importing Data from other sources like tables, CSV-Files, etc. the configured mapping declaration is being used as well.

## Adding New Mappings

## Adding new sources to the Similarity Finder
