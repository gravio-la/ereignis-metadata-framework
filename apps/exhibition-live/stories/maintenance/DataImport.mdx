# Importing Data from other Data Stores

Two kinds of import commands are available in the EDB Cli. The  `flatImport` command will import flat table structured documents
for example CSV files  and the `import` command will recursively import data from another data store.

```bash
bun run cli import Exhibition --importFrom oxigraph
```
The import command will recursively import data from another data store.

will import all documents of the type `Exhibition` from the oxigraph data store.
That means it will also import all related documents, like `Person` or `Place`, and their relations
in a recursive manner.
